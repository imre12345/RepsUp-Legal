        <h1>Privacy Policy - RepsUp</h1>
        <p class="header-meta"><strong>Last updated September 11, 2025</strong></p>

        <p>This Privacy Notice for Barták Imre Gergő ("<strong>we</strong>," "<strong>us</strong>," or "<strong>our</strong>"), describes how and why we might collect, store, use, and/or share ("<strong>process</strong>") your information when you use our services ("<strong>Services</strong>"), such as when you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Download and use our mobile application (RepsUp) or any other application of ours that links to this Privacy Notice.</li>
            <li>Engage with us in other related ways, including any sales, marketing, or events.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Questions or concerns?</strong> Reading this Privacy Notice will help you understand your privacy rights and choices. We are responsible for making decisions about how your personal information is processed. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, please do not use our Services. If you still have any questions or concerns, please contact us at <a href="mailto:repsup.privacy@gmail.com">repsup.privacy@gmail.com</a>.</p>

        <h2>SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS</h2>
        <p><strong><em>This summary provides key points from our Privacy Notice, but you can find out more details about any of these topics by using our table of contents below to find the section you are looking for.</em></strong></p>
        <p>A core principle of our Service is its privacy-first, on-device data architecture. All personal information you create and that is generated through your use of the application is stored exclusively on your personal device(s) (e.g., your iPhone and Apple Watch). We do not have servers, and we have no technical means to access, view, or process your personal information.</p>
        <p><strong>What personal information is processed on your device?</strong> When you use our Services, the application processes personal information that you create, such as your workout plans and performance history. With your explicit consent, the application can also process certain health data from Apple's HealthKit framework. All processing occurs locally on your device. Learn more about <a href="#infocollect">personal information processed by the Services</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Do we process any sensitive personal information?</strong> With your explicit consent, the application may access specific health data (heart rate and active energy) from Apple's HealthKit framework on your device. This data is used solely to provide in-app functionality (e.g., live heart rate display) and to allow you to save your completed workouts to the Apple Health app. This data is stored on your device and is never transmitted to us or any third party. Learn more about <a href="#sensitiveinfo">sensitive information we process</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Do we collect any information from third parties?</strong> We do not collect any information from third parties.</p>
        <p><strong>How is your information processed on your device?</strong> The application processes your information locally on your device to provide, improve, and administer the Services. This includes managing your workout plans, tracking your sessions, and displaying your performance history. We do not have access to your information and therefore do not process it for any other purpose. Learn more about <a href="#infoprocess">how we process your information</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>In what situations and with which parties do we share personal information?</strong> We do not have access to your personal information and therefore do not share it with any third parties. You, the user, may choose to save your completed workout data to the Apple Health app on your device, an action which you control entirely. Learn more about <a href="#whoshare">when and with whom we share your personal information</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>How is your information kept safe?</strong> Your information is stored locally on your personal Apple device(s) and is protected by the security measures of Apple's iOS and watchOS, such as your device passcode and system-level encryption. As we do not store your data on our servers, risks associated with server-side data breaches are eliminated. Learn more about <a href="#infosafe">how we keep your information safe</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>What are your privacy rights?</strong> Because all your data resides on your device, you have direct and complete control over it. You can access, edit, and delete your data at any time directly within the application or by managing the application on your device. Learn more about <a href="#privacyrights">your privacy rights</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>How do you exercise your rights?</strong> The easiest way to exercise your rights is by managing your data directly within the RepsUp application or through your device's settings. For questions about this policy, you may contact us at <a href="mailto:repsup.privacy@gmail.com">repsup.privacy@gmail.com</a>. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>

        <h2 id="infocollect">1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h2>
        <h3>Personal information you disclose to us</h3>
        <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> The Service processes personal information that you provide and create, which is stored locally on your device.</em></p>
        <p>The Service processes personal information that you voluntarily provide when you create workout plans, track your fitness activities, or otherwise use the features of the Services. We, the developer, do not collect this information or have any access to it.</p>
        <p><strong>Personal Information Provided by You.</strong> The personal information that the Service processes depends on the context of your interactions with the Services and the features you use. This information is created by you and stored on your device. The personal information processed may include the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Workout and Exercise Data:</strong> This includes workout names, exercise names, and parameters you define such as sets, repetitions (reps), rest times, and weight data (including the unit, e.g., kg or lbs).</li>
            <li><strong>Personal Notes:</strong> Optional notes that you can add to specific exercises.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="sensitiveinfo">Sensitive Information</h3>
        <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> With your explicit consent, the Service can access specific health data from Apple's HealthKit framework on your device to provide workout-related features. This data is never transmitted to us.</em></p>
        <p>With your explicit consent, the Service processes the following categories of sensitive information by accessing them from Apple's HealthKit framework on your device:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Health Data:</strong> We request permission to read heart rate and active energy burned (calories) during a workout session. Heart rate is displayed live on your Apple Watch for real-time feedback. Active energy data is used solely for the purpose of saving your completed workout to the Apple Health app, which contributes to your Activity Rings. This calorie data is not displayed within the RepsUp application itself. This data is stored on your device as part of your completed workout history and is never transmitted to us.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Application Data</h3>
        <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> If you use our application, it may request access to certain device features to enable its functionality. All related data and processing occur on your device.</em></p>
        <p>If you use our application(s), it may request access or permission to certain features from your mobile device to enable core functionality. All processing occurs locally on your device.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mobile Device Access.</strong> The Service may request access or permission to certain features from your mobile device, including your mobile device's Health Data (via HealthKit). This access is required to read heart rate and calorie data during a workout and to save the completed workout to your Apple Health database. If you wish to change our access or permissions, you may do so in your device's Settings app.</li>
            <li><strong>Push Notifications.</strong> The Service may request permission to send you local notifications on your device. These are used solely for functional purposes, such as alerting you when a rest timer is complete. We do not send marketing or promotional notifications. If you wish to opt out from receiving these types of communications, you may turn them off in your device's settings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="infoprocess">2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
        <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> The application processes your information locally on your device to provide, improve, and administer the Services. We do not have access to your information.</em></p>
        <p>The application processes your personal information on your device for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with our Services, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To deliver and facilitate the delivery of services to the user.</strong> The application processes your information to provide you with the requested service, such as creating and managing workout plans.</li>
            <li><strong>Workout Planning and Management.</strong> To store, organize, and display the workout plans and exercises that you create, including your custom sets, reps, weights, and notes.</li>
            <li><strong>Workout Session Tracking.</strong> To guide you through your planned workout sessions, track your progress, and manage timers for sets and rest periods.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance History and Analytics.</strong> To save a log of your completed workouts and process this history to provide you with aggregate statistics and performance charts, all of which are generated and displayed on your device.</li>
            <li><strong>Inter-Device Data Synchronization.</strong> To securely synchronize your workout plans and completed session data between your paired iPhone and Apple Watch using Apple's frameworks.</li>
            <li><strong>To provide timely workout alerts.</strong> To send local notifications on your device to alert you when a rest timer is complete.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="legalbases">3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
        <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</em></p>
        <p><em><strong>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</strong></em></p>
        <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. This is the basis for accessing HealthKit data. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about withdrawing your consent.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance of a Contract.</strong> We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, which consists of providing the on-device features and functionality of the Services.</li>
            <li><strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to provide a seamless and consistent user experience across your personal devices.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
            <li><strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em><strong>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</strong></em></p>
        <p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.</p>
        <p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent.</p>

        <h2 id="whoshare">4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
        <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We do not have access to your personal information and therefore do not share it with any third parties. You may choose to share your data with Apple's Health app.</em></p>
        <p>We do not have access to your personal information and therefore do not share it with any third parties. The architecture of the Service is designed to make such sharing technically impossible from our end.</p>
        <h3>User-Initiated Sharing with Apple Health</h3>
        <p>With your explicit consent, you can instruct the application to save your completed workout data to your personal Apple Health database on your device. This may include data such as workout type, duration, and total active energy burned. This is an optional feature that you control entirely through your device's system settings for HealthKit permissions.</p>
        <h3>Data Synchronization Between Your Devices</h3>
        <p>The Service synchronizes your workout data between your paired iPhone and Apple Watch. This transfer occurs using Apple's secure WatchConnectivity framework and the data remains within your personal ecosystem of devices.</p>
        <h3>Business Transfers</h3>
        <p>If we sell our business, assets, or merge with another company, the transaction will not include any of your personal information. This is because all user data is stored exclusively on users' personal devices and is not accessible to us or stored in any company-controlled database.</p>

        <h2 id="inforetain">5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
        <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We do not keep your information. All personal information is stored exclusively on your personal device(s) and is retained for as long as you keep the application installed.</em></p>
        <p>We do not collect or store any of your personal information on our servers. All personal information processed by the Services is stored exclusively on your personal device(s). The information is retained on your device for as long as the application is installed. You have full control over your data and can delete it at any time by using the deletion options within the app's settings or by deleting the application from your device.</p>
        <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

        <h2 id="infosafe">6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
        <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> Your information is protected by the security features of your Apple device(s). We do not store your data, eliminating the risk of server-side breaches from our end.</em></p>
        <p>The security of your personal information is a direct result of the security of your personal device. All data is stored locally within the application's sandboxed environment on your iPhone and Apple Watch. This data is protected by the comprehensive security measures built into Apple's iOS and watchOS, including hardware-level encryption, your device passcode, and optional Face ID or Touch ID authentication.</p>
        <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

        <h2 id="infominors">7. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>
        <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to minors, as we do not collect any user data at all.</em></p>
        <p>Our Service is not intended for or directed to individuals under the age of 16. The Service is designed to operate entirely on-device; as such, the Developer does not collect and cannot access any personal information from any user, including children under 16. All data is stored exclusively on the user's personal device. If a user under the age of 16 has created data within the Service, the responsibility for managing or removing that information lies with the user or their legal guardian by deleting the data within the app or by deleting the app itself.</p>

        <h2 id="privacyrights">8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
        <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> Because all your data is stored locally on your device, you have direct and complete control over it. You can exercise your rights at any time without needing to contact us.</em></p>
        <p>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability.</p>
        <p>Because RepsUp stores all your personal information directly and exclusively on your device, you can exercise these rights directly, giving you complete control over your data.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Right to Access, Review, and Update:</strong> You can access, review, and update your workout plans and history directly within the application's interface at any time.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Delete (Erasure):</strong> You can delete your personal information at any time by deleting the RepsUp application from your device(s). Deleting the application permanently removes all associated data from that device.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Control Consent (HealthKit):</strong> You can manage or withdraw your consent for HealthKit access at any time through the Apple Health app or your device's main Settings app under "Health" > "Data Access & Devices" > "RepsUp."</li>
            <li><strong>Inapplicability of Data Subject Access Requests (DSARs):</strong> Please note that because we do not collect, store, or have any access to your personal information, traditional data subject access requests (e.g., requesting a copy of your data from us) are not applicable. All of your data resides on your device, under your control.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to Data Portability and Export:</strong> You have the right to receive your personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format. The application provides a feature in the Settings screen that allows you to export a complete copy of all your workout and health data as a JSON file, which you can then keep for your records or use with other services.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at <a href="mailto:repsup.privacy@gmail.com">repsup.privacy@gmail.com</a>.</p>

        <h2 id="dnt">9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
        <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. The RepsUp application does not engage in online tracking of its users. The Service functions primarily offline and does not transmit browsing or activity data to us or any third party. As such, DNT signals are not applicable to the Services.</p>

        <h2 id="uslaws">10. DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
        <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> If you are a resident of certain US states, you have specific rights regarding your personal information. With RepsUp, you exercise these rights directly on your device.</em></p>
        <p>If you are a resident of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, or Virginia, you may have the right to request access to and receive details about the personal information we maintain about you and how we have processed it, correct inaccuracies, get a copy of, or delete your personal information.</p>
        <h3>Categories of Personal Information We Collect</h3>
        <p>The following table details the categories of personal information the Service processes on your device. We, the developer, do not collect or have access to this information.</p>

        <p>We will use and retain the collected personal information as needed to provide the Services or for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Category B, E, H, L</strong> - All personal and sensitive information, including health and sensory data, is stored exclusively on the user's personal device(s). We, the developer, do not have access to this information. The information is retained on the user's device for as long as the application is installed. The user has full control over their data and can delete it at any time by using deletion options within the app or by deleting the application itself.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Will your information be shared with anyone else?</h3>
        <p>We have not disclosed, sold, or shared any personal information to third parties for a business or commercial purpose in the preceding twelve (12) months. Our service architecture makes it technically impossible for us to do so, as all your data is stored exclusively on your device.</p>
        <h3>How to Exercise Your Rights</h3>
        <p>You exercise your rights directly on your device. To access or correct your data, use the editing features within the RepsUp app. To delete your data, uninstall the app from your device. To manage consent for health data, use the Settings app on your iPhone. Because you control your data directly on your device, a formal verification process is not required.</p>

        <h2 id="otherregions">11. DO OTHER REGIONS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
        <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> You may have additional rights based on the country you reside in.</em></p>
        <h3>Australia and New Zealand</h3>
        <p>We collect and process your personal information under the obligations and conditions set by Australia's Privacy Act 1988 and New Zealand's Privacy Act 2020 (Privacy Act). This Privacy Notice satisfies the notice requirements defined in both Privacy Acts.

        <h2 id="coreprinciple">12. CORE ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLE: ON-DEVICE DATA STORAGE</h2>
        <p>RepsUp is fundamentally designed with a 'privacy-first' architecture. A core principle of the Service is that it operates without any backend servers controlled by the Developer. All personal information you create or that is generated through your use of the App, including your workout plans, session history, and any sensitive health data accessed via Apple's HealthKit, is stored exclusively and securely on your personal Apple device(s) (i.e., your iPhone and/or Apple Watch). The Developer has no technical means to access, view, or process your personal information. This on-device storage model is an intentional design choice to ensure that you, the user, remain in complete control of your data at all times, thereby eliminating risks associated with server-side data breaches and external data transfers.</p>

        <h2 id="updates">13. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</h2>
        <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.</em></p>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Last updated" date. If we make material changes to this Privacy Notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this Privacy Notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.</p>
