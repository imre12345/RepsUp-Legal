This data is used to save the completed workout to the Apple Health app, contributing to the user's Activity Rings.</li>

        <h2 id="infocollect">1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h2>
        <h3>Personal information you disclose to us</h3>
        <p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong><em> We collect personal information that you provide to us.</em></p>
        <p>We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and Services, when you participate in activities on the Services, or otherwise when you contact us.</p>
        <p><strong>Personal Information Provided by You.</strong> The personal information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us and the Services, the choices you make, and the products and features you use.

            <li>personal notes for exercises</li>
            <li>weight data (including unit in kg or lbs)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Sensitive Information.</strong> When necessary, with your consent or as otherwise permitted by applicable law, we process the following categories of sensitive information:</p>
        <ul>

        <ul>
            <li><em>Mobile Device Access.</em> We may request access or permission to certain features from your mobile device, including your mobile device's sensors, notifications, health data (via HealthKit), and other features. If you wish to change our access or permissions, you may do so in your device's settings.</li>
            <li><em>Push Notifications.</em> We may request to send you push notifications regarding your account or certain features of the application(s). If you wish to opt out from receiving these types of communications, you may turn them off in your device's settings.</li>

        <p>This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our application(s), for troubleshooting, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.</p>
        <p>All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information.</p>

        <h2 id="infouse">2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
        <p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong><em> We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our Services, communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also process your information for other purposes with your consent.</em></p>
        <p>We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with our Services, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To deliver and facilitate delivery of services to the user.</strong> We may process your information to provide you with the requested service.</li>
            <li><strong>To save or protect an individual's vital interest.</strong> We may process your information when necessary to save or protect an individual’s vital interest, such as to prevent harm.</li>
            <li><strong>Workout Planning and Management.</strong> To store, organize, and display the workout plans and exercises that you create, including your custom sets, reps, weights, and notes.</li>
            <li><strong>Workout Session Tracking.</strong> To guide you through your planned workout sessions and manage timers for sets and rest periods.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance History and Analytics.</strong> To save a log of your completed workouts and process this history to provide you with aggregate statistics.</li>
            <li><strong>To provide timely workout alerts.</strong> To send local notifications on your device to alert you when a rest timer is complete.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="legalbases">3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
        <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</em></p>
        <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Consent.</strong> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance of a Contract.</strong> We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.</li>
            <li><strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>
            <li><strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="whoshare">4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
        <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We do not share your personal information with any third-party companies for marketing, analytics, or advertising purposes. The only instance of "sharing" occurs when you grant the app permission to save your completed workouts to Apple's Health app (HealthKit).</em></p>
        <p>We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>With your consent:</strong> When you complete a workout and have granted permission, the app shares your workout data (such as duration, heart rate, and calories) with Apple's HealthKit service on your device. This data is governed by Apple's privacy policy.</li>
            <li><strong>Business Transfers.</strong> We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="inforetain">5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
        <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> All personal information is stored exclusively on your personal device(s). The information is retained on your device for as long as the application is installed.</em></p>
        <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice. All personal information is stored exclusively on the user's personal device(s). We, the developer, do not have access to this information. The information is retained on the user's device for as long as the application is installed. The user has full control over their data and can delete it at any time by using the deletion options within the app's settings or by deleting the application from their device.</p>
        
        <h2 id="infosafe">6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
        <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> The security of your data is handled by Apple's robust on-device security features. Since we do not store your data on our servers, you are responsible for securing your own device.</em></p>
        <p>The security of your information is handled by the robust security features of Apple's iOS and watchOS operating systems, including hardware-level encryption. As we do not store your data on any external servers, the responsibility for securing your device (e.g., using a passcode and enabling security features) lies with you.</p>

        <h2 id="infominors">7. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>
        <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to minors.</em></p>
        <p>Our Service is not intended for or directed to individuals under the age of 16. Users must be at least 16 years of age or the legal age of majority in their jurisdiction to use the Service. The App is designed to operate entirely offline; as such, the Developer does not collect and cannot access any personal information from any user, including children under 16. All data is stored exclusively on the user's personal device. If a user under the age of 16 has created data within the App, the responsibility for removing that information lies with the user or their legal guardian by deleting the data within the App's settings or by deleting the App itself.</p>

        <h2 id="privacyrights">8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
        <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> You have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or delete your data at any time directly within the app.</em></p>
        <p>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; and (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information. Because all of your data is stored locally on your device, you have the direct ability to exercise these rights at any time by accessing, editing, or deleting your data from within the app.</p>
        <p><strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information (such as for HealthKit access), you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time through your device's system Settings.</p>

        <h2 id="DNT">9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
        <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. As our Services do not track users online, these signals are not applicable.</p>

        <h2 id="uslaws">10. DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
        <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> Yes, various US states provide specific privacy rights. As RepsUp stores all data locally on your device, you already have direct control to exercise these rights.</em></p>
        <p>The privacy rights described in various US state laws are primarily designed for services that collect and store user data on central servers. As RepsUp stores all your personal data exclusively on your own device, you already have direct and complete control. You can review, update, or delete all of your workout data at any time directly within the App's settings.</p>
        
        <h2 id="clausea">11. CORE ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLE: ON-DEVICE DATA STORAGE</h2>
        <p>RepsUp is fundamentally designed with a 'privacy-first' architecture. A core principle of the Service is that it operates without any backend servers controlled by the Developer. All personal information you create or that is generated through your use of the App, including your workout plans, session history, and any sensitive health data accessed via Apple's HealthKit, is stored exclusively and securely on your personal Apple device(s) (i.e., your iPhone and/or Apple Watch). The Developer has no technical means to access, view, or process your personal information. This on-device storage model is an intentional design choice to ensure that you, the user, remain in complete control of your data at all times, thereby eliminating risks associated with server-side data breaches and external data transfers.</p>

        <h2 id="policyupdates">12. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</h2>
        <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.</em></p>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Notice. We encourage you to review this Privacy Notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.</p>

        <h2 id="contact">13. HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</h2>
        <p>If you have questions or comments about this notice, you may email us at <a href="mailto:repsup.privacy@gmail.com">repsup.privacy@gmail.com</a> or contact us by post at:</p>

        <h2 id="request">14. HOW CAN YOU REVIEW, UPDATE, OR DELETE THE DATA WE COLLECT FROM YOU?</h2>
        <p>Based on the applicable laws of your country, you may have the right to request access to the personal information we collect from you, correct inaccuracies, or delete your personal information. As all your data is stored on your device, you can directly perform these actions yourself within the app or by deleting the app.</p>
