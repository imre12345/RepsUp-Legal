        <h1>TERMS OF SERVICE</h1>
        <p class="header-meta"><strong>Last updated September 10, 2025</strong></p>

        <h2>1. AGREEMENT TO OUR LEGAL TERMS</h2>
        <p>We are Barták Imre Gergő, doing business as the Developer ("<strong>the Developer</strong>," "<strong>we</strong>," "<strong>us</strong>," "<strong>our</strong>"), located at Belgrád rkp. 22, Budapest 1056, Hungary.</p>
        <p>We operate the mobile application RepsUp ("<strong>App</strong>"), as well as any other related products and services that refer or link to these legal terms (the "<strong>Legal Terms</strong>") (collectively, the "<strong>Services</strong>").</p>
        <p>RepsUp is a fitness application for iOS and watchOS designed for workout planning, tracking, and analysis. Users can create and customize detailed workout plans by defining exercises, sets, repetitions, rest times, and weight information. These plans can be organized in either a calendar schedule or an ordered list. During a workout, the app guides the user through their session. When used with a paired Apple Watch and with the user's explicit consent, the app can integrate with Apple's HealthKit to track real-time health metrics, including heart rate and active calories burned. After completing a session, the app stores a detailed log of the workout, allowing users to review their history, track aggregate statistics, and analyze their performance over time.</p>
        <p>You can contact us by email at <a href="mailto:repsup.privacy@gmail.com">repsup.privacy@gmail.com</a> or by mail to Belgrád rkp. 22, Budapest 1056, Hungary.</p>
        <p>These Legal Terms constitute a legally binding agreement made between you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity ("<strong>you</strong>"), and Barták Imre Gergő, concerning your access to and use of the Services. You agree that by accessing the Services, you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by all of these Legal Terms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THESE LEGAL TERMS, THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING THE SERVICES AND YOU MUST DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.</p>
        <p>For any material changes to these terms, we will make reasonable efforts to provide notice. The "Effective Date" at the top of the legal terms will always be updated to reflect the latest revision. By continuing to use the service after a revision becomes effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.</p>
